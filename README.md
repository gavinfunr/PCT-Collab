# point-cloud-toolbox

![alt text](https://github.com/masnottuh/point-cloud-toolbox/blob/main/img/torus.png)

Python library for point cloud processing. The main emphasis is on discrete curvature measures, for now. 

The utilities live within the PointCloud class in pointCloudToolbox.py, you can see the implementation of known expressions for curvature within.

The work presented here is part of active research at the University of Nevada, Reno - please contact me if you would like to talk about the tools within.
